Welcome to Bergen, and to our home!

We're very happy to have you as our guests — thank you for choosing us. We hope our house will provide the comforts you need for a relaxing visit.

Before you settle in, we'd like to remind you that this is more than just a place to stay; it's our home, and we kindly ask that you treat it with the same care and respect you would your own.

While you're here, we'll be at our cabin on an island just outside of Bergen. If there's an emergency or you need assistance during your stay, please reach out. We're not very far away.

We hope this information folder will provide useful insights about our home and the area, as well as recommendations for exploring Bergen's hidden gems.

Enjoy your stay, and please leave a review.

Warm regards,
Christine and Håkon
